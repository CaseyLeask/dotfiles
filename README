# SSH-Agent

It's currently set up for OS X. You still need to run
```bash
    ssh-add -K 
```
To add the ssh key to the OS X keychain.

For Ubuntu, switch the code in use at ssh-agent-restore.zsh

For ssh sessions, disable the automatic ssh-key init, as it can cause problems with expected responses.
